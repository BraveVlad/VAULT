# VAULT

## TODOS:

- [ ] Build app with multiple routes (including dynamics), data fetching with react-query and break to seperate components, focus on data locality.

- [ ] use useMutation to update the server and invalidate queries

- [ ] add support to a native feature (screenshot?)

- [ ] use initalData/placeholderData to show data in a specific query when data already exists in a more general query. 

- [ ] use real server instead of mocks

- [ ] instead of invalidating queries, perform optimistic update.
